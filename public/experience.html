    <h1>2023: Some Frogs</h1>
    <p>
      In 2023, I spent six months responsible for technology at Some Frogs. I had full responsibility for the
      development of
      the startup's first MVP, a content curation app, which we launched already a month after I joined and saw
      thousands of
      users during the following months of development. I was also responsible
      for tech operations and internal tools.
